You have the option to pay for all the regular events at the beginning of the season. 7 events for the price of 6! This must be done before or at the first event.<br />
Events are open for pre-registration 30 days prior to the event and close when within 3 days. There is a pre-reg maximum of 40. After that you must wait and register at the event which will be first-come, first-serve. The current limit on total entries stands at 60, though this may increase as time goes on this year.
